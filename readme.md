# Polisplexity Digital Social Twin

**I. Overview**

1.1 Project summary

This project is an integrated digital twin solution designed to tackle urban waste management by combining two dimensions: a *physical digital twin* that models and optimizes the flow of waste through cities, and a *social digital twin* that engages directly with citizens via intelligent conversational agents. The platform links data-driven urban infrastructure with real-time citizen interactions, creating a new approach to fostering circular economy practices in waste disposal.

1.2 Key objectives

* Develop a scalable system that reduces inefficiencies in urban waste collection and disposal.
* Empower citizens to actively participate in improving environmental outcomes by offering them personalized insights and incentives.
* Demonstrate how combining advanced data infrastructure, geospatial analysis, and conversational AI can transform public services into more sustainable, participatory systems.
* Prepare a path for integrating decentralized smart contract orchestration through Qubic to enable transparent, tamper-proof incentives and governance.

**II. Context & Problem**

2.1 The challenge of waste management in modern cities

Traditional urban waste management systems are under increasing strain. Rapid urbanization, consumer habits, and logistical constraints mean that cities often struggle with inefficient waste collection routes, overflowing bins, and missed pickups. This not only elevates operational costs but also contributes to environmental issues such as increased CO‚ÇÇ emissions from redundant truck routes and improper waste separation.

2.2 The untapped role of citizens

Despite being the primary generators of waste, citizens typically have little direct involvement in optimizing waste flows. Traditional systems treat them mainly as passive sources of waste. This ignores the huge potential of community participation, especially if individuals are incentivized to reduce, sort, or properly schedule their waste disposals.

2.3 Why conventional digital twins fall short

Digital twins‚Äîvirtual replicas of physical systems‚Äîare commonly used to optimize infrastructure, including transportation and utilities. However, most implementations focus only on physical assets and logistics. They neglect the social dimension: the behaviors, decisions, and micro-incentives that drive much of the waste problem. Without integrating this human layer, traditional digital twins miss an opportunity for deeper systemic impact.

2.4 Towards a new paradigm: the social + physical digital twin

By blending a high-fidelity digital model of the waste system (powered by AI, supercomputing, and geospatial data) with an interactive citizen interface (via Telegram bots and other platforms), this project pioneers a dual twin approach. Citizens aren‚Äôt just data points‚Äîthey become participants, whose interactions can directly modify how the system allocates resources and plans routes.

**III. Our Approach**

3.1 The physical digital twin on VULTR

We deploy a Django-based urban intelligence platform on VULTR, a scalable cloud environment. This platform models the physical dimension of the waste system, integrating geospatial data, traffic flows, and municipal waste generation statistics. It uses Snowflake for heavy data transformations and to build optimized routing scenarios, dramatically cutting planning times from weeks to hours.

3.2 The social digital twin using Coral agents

For the social layer, we use Coral‚Äîan open-source multi-agent orchestration framework. Here, we run intelligent agents (powered by GROQ‚Äôs GPT-4.1 and local Ollama models with LLaMA 3) that connect directly to citizens via Telegram bots. These agents can answer questions like ‚ÄúWhen will my next pickup be?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow can I reduce my CO‚ÇÇ footprint?‚Äù and adjust local waste collection strategies based on aggregate feedback.

3.3 Enabling a circular economy with the Green Coin

We integrate a novel incentive system: the Green Coin. This digital asset rewards citizens for actions that lower the system‚Äôs CO‚ÇÇ impact‚Äîlike scheduling pickups, sorting waste correctly, or reporting bin levels. These coins can be exchanged for discounts on private waste pickups or local eco-services, creating the foundations of a circular economy tied directly to community behavior.

3.4 Roadmap: bringing Qubic into the ecosystem

As the project matures, we plan to migrate the Green Coin logic and smart incentives to the Qubic Network. This means rewriting core contracts in C++, deploying on Qubic for high performance and low-cost transactions, and exploring:

Qubic-based ledgers for decentralized tracking of citizen eco-actions.

Smart contracts that allocate rewards dynamically based on system-level CO‚ÇÇ optimizations.

Potential integration with a Solana bridge or future Qubic DEXs to allow Green Coin liquidity.

**IV. How to Run & Install**

4.1 Prerequisites

* Docker & Docker Compose installed on your machine (Linux or Mac recommended for simplicity).
* Optional: Python 3.10+ and `uv` if you want to run agents outside Docker for debugging.
* A VULTR instance (or similar VPS) if deploying the physical twin (Django + Snowflake integration).
* API keys for OpenAI or GROQ, plus local Ollama models installed for hybrid operation.

4.2 Running the Coral-based social digital twin locally

We structure the repository as a monorepo with:

```
coral/
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ coral-server/       # Kotlin server orchestrating agents & sessions
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ coral-studio/       # Frontend UI to monitor agents
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ coral-agents/
 ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ interface-agent/  # Main conversational orchestrator
 ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ groq-agent/       # Uses GROQ GPT-4.1
 ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ollama-agent/     # Uses local LLaMA 3 models
 ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ voice-interface/  # Placeholder for future voice agents
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml
```

To start everything (server + studio + agents) with Docker:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

You can then navigate to:

* Coral Studio UI: [http://localhost:3010](http://localhost:3010)
* Coral Server API: [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555)

For development, run agents in their own terminals with:

```bash
cd coral-agents/interface-agent
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync
uv run python main.py
```

4.3 Running the physical twin on VULTR

On the VULTR instance:

* Deploy the Django app (from a separate repo) which handles routing optimization & Snowflake integrations.
* Ensure it is accessible via a domain or IP. This service acts as the foundation of the digital representation of waste infrastructure.

**V. Future Vision: Qubic Integration**

5.1 Why Qubic?

Qubic represents the next frontier for decentralized computing‚Äîoffering quorum-based smart contracts in C++ that are ultra-fast, scalable, and designed for real-world adoption. This aligns perfectly with our broader goal: using advanced computational models (AI + digital twins) to rethink waste management, incentives, and urban circular economies.

By building on Qubic, we move critical parts of our incentive logic (the ‚ÄúGreen Coin‚Äù ecosystem) onto a decentralized, tamper-proof ledger. This ensures transparency, citizen trust, and opens pathways for interoperable climate credits.

5.2 How we plan to integrate

* **Smart Contracts in C++:** We will write Qubic smart contracts to handle token issuance and validation of waste events.
* **AI-enhanced audit tools:** Plan to develop or integrate an AI pipeline that verifies the behavior of these smart contracts, reducing risk.
* **Data bridges:** Future roadmap includes creating bridges from our Django+Snowflake physical digital twin data into Qubic, ensuring waste events and environmental metrics are cryptographically recorded.

5.3 Roadmap for Qubic hackathon and beyond

* Phase 1: Deploy a Qubic contract that mints Green Coins when validated waste drop events are reported from the digital twin.
* Phase 2: Extend to include derivatives for local circular economies (e.g., waste futures tied to compost outputs).
* Phase 3: Build an EVM environment within Qubic to allow traditional DeFi tools to interact with our system.

5.4 How this fulfills Qubic hackathon goals

‚úÖ **Desirability:** Addresses urban circular economies using decentralized incentives.

‚úÖ **Feasibility:** Proven hybrid with Docker + Django + Coral. Qubic smart contracts handle only the critical value layer.

‚úÖ **Viability:** Cities & NGOs can use the system to certify sustainable disposal, unlocking environmental finance.

‚úÖ **Technical Complexity:** Combines C++ smart contracts on Qubic with real-time AI agents & twin data pipelines.

‚úÖ **Quality:** Designed to be modular, secure, and ready for gradual Qubic-first migration.
